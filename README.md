# What is a NEF emulator?

A Network Exposure Function (NEF) emulator is a tool used for testing and validating the behavior of a 5G network's NEF in a simulated environment. An NEF is a key component of a 5G network that provides policy and charging rules for managing network resources and services for different user types and applications.

The NEF emulator replicates the behavior of the actual NEF and provides a testing environment for developers and network operators to ensure that the NEF is functioning correctly and efficiently before it is deployed in a live network. This helps to reduce the risk of errors and issues that could impact the network's performance and user experience.

The NEF emulator can be used to test different scenarios and use cases, such as varying traffic loads, network congestion, and different types of devices and applications. This helps to identify potential issues and optimize the NEF's performance and scalability.

The NEF emulator is built using several tools, including the Flask web framework, PyYAML for configuration, and gRPC for communication with the 5G core network. The emulator includes a RESTful API that enables developers and network operators to interact with the NEF and perform various operations, such as creating policies and rules, managing users and applications, and monitoring network traffic.

## ⚙ Setup locally

**Host prerequisites**: `Docker version 23.0.1`, `Docker Compose v2`, `build-essential`\*, `jq`\*\*

After cloning the repository, there are 4 more steps to do. For convinience, we have created a [`Makefile`](Makefile) that contains a command for each step + several common `docker-compose` tasks which you may find handy in the future.

1. create your local `.env` file
2. build the container images
3. run the containers
4. add some test data (optional)

```bash
cd NEF_CAMARA_EMULATOR

# 1.
make prepare-dev-env

# 2.
make build

# 3.
make up

# 4.
make db-init
```

>\* 💡 Info: *To use the `make` command you need to `apt install build-essential` first. In case you don't want to proceed with this installation, you can head over to the `Makefile` and copy/paste the shell commands that are being used for every step.*

> \*\* 💡 Info: *The shell script used at step 4 (for adding test data) uses `jq` which is a lightweight and flexible command-line JSON processor. You can install it with `apt install jq`*

### Try out your setup

After the containers are up and running:

 - access and start playing with the Swager UI at: [http://localhost:8090/nef/docs](http://localhost:8090/nef/docs) or [https://localhost:4443/nef/docs](http://localhost:4443/nef/docs)
 - login to the admin dashboard at: [http://localhost:8090/login](http://localhost:8090) or [https://localhost:4443/login](http://localhost:4443/login)
     - Default credentials: `admin@my-email.com` / `pass`
     - they can be found/changed inside your `.env` file

## 🏷️ How to work on a specific tag / release

After `git clone` or `git pull` you can specify the release you want to work on by just using its `tag` in the following command:

    git switch --detach tag_here

You will get into a *detached HEAD* state in Git, but this is perfectly fine, you can go back anytime by just using `git switch main`.  
Short reasoning on why we choose tags over branches:

>**A tag is immutable.**

## Integration with CAPIF

In order to integrate NEF Emulator with CAPIF you should perform the following steps:

1. Ensure that all CAPIF services are up and running. Clone the code from the official Github repository https://github.com/EVOLVED-5G/CAPIF_API_Services, navigate to the `services/` directory and execute the following commands:

```
cd services/
sudo ./run.sh
./check_services_are_running.sh
```
These commands will start the CAPIF services and ensure that they are running correctly.

2. Configure the NEF Emulator project to join the CAPIF network by following one of the below steps based on your deployment requirements:

  - For local deployment:
Update the `EXTERNAL_NET` environment variable to `true` in the `.env` file of the NEF Emulator project. This will allow NEF containers to join CAPIF's pre-existing network called `services_default`. If you do not want to use NEF Emulator with CAPIF, change the `EXTERNAL_NET` environment variable back to false in the `.env` file. Add the following entry to the `/etc/hosts` file of the host machine:
```
127.0.0.1 capifcore
```
> This entry maps the hostname "capifcore" to the IP address `127.0.0.1`, which is the loopback address of the local network interface.

  - For deployment in separate VMs:
Update the `EXTERNAL_NET` environment variable to `false` in the `.env` file of the NEF Emulator project. Add the following entry to the `/etc/hosts` file of the host machine:
```
<ip-of-capif> capifcore
```
> This entry maps the hostname "capifcore" to the IP address of the machine that CAPIF is running on.

3. Start the NEF services by executing either the make up or make debug-up command in the NEF Emulator project directory.

> 💡 Once you have completed these steps, NEF should be successfully onboarded to the CAPIF Core Function. To confirm this, check that 12 files have been created in the `app/core/certificates/` folder.
